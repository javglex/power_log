# POWER LOG

Powerlifters, this is your logger.
This logger is focused for power lifting workouts. That means adding, editing, and analyzing your power lifts should be quick and easy to do. The UX is optimized for those with chalked up fingers, adrenaline running through their veins, and those who want to get back to their workout asap.
